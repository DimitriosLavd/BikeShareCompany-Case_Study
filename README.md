# BikeShareCompany-Case_Study
An -one week- data analysis case study for a bike share company. Includes Python and SQL codes. 
### Project Overview-case study scenario
You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a
bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s
future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members
use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new
marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic
executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with
compelling data insights and professional data visualizations. 1.2 Data Analysis Objectives
The company leaders are determined to make data driven decisions regarding their
future strategy. The future marketing program will be guided by the following
questions. 

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

We are assigned to provide data-driven insights in order to answer the first
question. We need to analyze the data, in order to identify trends that show how
annual members and casual users use the company’s services differently.Analyzing
these differences correctly will be the key for answering the other two questions
and achieving the company’s objective.
